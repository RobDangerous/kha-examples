# kha-examples
just some simple kha examples - for new users

have fun - hopefully the comments make sense [if i put them in that is] ;)

to run these projects. please use the super, uber, duper sexy [kode studio](https://github.com/KTXSoftware/KodeStudio/releases)
its highly recommended because it really makes using kha that much better, plus makes everything easier

follow this super useful post on getting up and running with it - [kode studio forum post](http://kode.tech/kode-studio-16-1/)
